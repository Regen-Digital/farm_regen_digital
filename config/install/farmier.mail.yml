  subject: 'Your Digital Twin is ready to setup'
  body: |-
    You are undertaking the Environmental Farm Assessment and as part of that we are setting you up with a Digital Twin of your farm.

    Your Digital Twin is like a website for your farm and it will reflect your farm as data, maps and models in the digital economy.

    The Digital Twin of your farm is: yours. You own it.

    You decide who gets access to what information within it. It's yours in the same way any other asset that you buy is yours.

    If you want to take your Digital Twin and host it somewhere else you can. It's yours.

    If you want to do nothing with it you can. It's yours.

    You will "evolve" and use your Digital Twin more over time as you continue to work with Regen Farmers Mutual.
